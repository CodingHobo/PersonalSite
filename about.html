    I spent 25+ wonderful years in the music business both on stage and in production roles.
    I've worked in every performance environment from sheds to arenas to outdoor amphitheaters and
    festival sites. I lived on the road and traveled internationally Tour Managing some great bands:
    the B-52s, Leftover Salmon, Elephant Revival and Dark Star Orchestra, to name a few.
    I have had the pleasure of running production for many, many artists including Levon Helm,
    Snoop Dogg, Keb' Mo, Blake Shelton, Lucinda Williams, Bela Fleck, Loretta Lynn, Primus, The Indigo Girls,
    Sonic Youth, Little Feat, The Black Crowes, Peter Frampton, Wilco, and Ween.
  </p>

    <p>
    I have had the honor of sharing the stage and singing with some incredible artists including the late
    Bernie Worrell (Parliament Funkadelic, Talking Heads), Adrian Belew (Frank Zappa), Alphonso Johnson (Weather
    Report),
    Bobby Vega (Etta James), Donna Jean Godcheaux (The Grateful Dead), George Porter, Jr. (The Funky Meters),
    Mike Gordon (Phish), Jon Fishman (Phish), Jeff Coffin (Dave Matthews Band), Steve Kimock, Fred Tackett (Little
    Feat),
    Bill Kreutzmann (The Grateful Dead), and Oteil Burbridge (Allman Brothers, Dead & Company).
  </p>

    <p>
      In 2016, I had the distinct honor of headlining Red Rocks Amphitheater as a vocalist for The Motet, with Vulfpeck and
    Medeski, Martin and Wood as support.
    </p>

    <p>
  I have performed and/or worked in various capacities for New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, JamCruise,
    Wakarusa Music and Camping Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, Smilefest, Harvest Fest at Mulberry Mountain,
    Berkshire Mountain Music Festival, Dickson Street Music Festival, Down on the Farm, Camp Bisco, All Good Music
    Festival,
    and Dark Star Jubilee and was the site designer for the inaugural 4848 Festival in 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
    I "retired" from the music industry in 2020 to fulfill a lifelong dream of studying abroad and enrolled in a
    one-year intensive course for Interior Design at Florence Design Academy, a prestigious design school in the
    historic
    and stunning city of Florence, Italy. While Covid had a significant impact on my overall experience, I proudly
    completed the course with honors and earned my diploma. This experience rekindled my passion for learning and my
    love of cultural immersion.
    </p>
    <p>
    Throughout my years in the music business during down-times or between tours, I found great interest in learning
    code and design platforms and am self-taught in web design, graphic design, and Adobe CS software. While studying in
    Florence, I took particular interest in AutoCAD and 3ds Max. I am currently diving deeper into these interests as a
    student at Rithm School, working my way towards becoming a Software Engineer, and look forward to seeing how all of
    my
    interests may intersect as I hone these skills.
